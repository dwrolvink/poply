Very much still under construction, more of an idea than a working concept at this stage!

# poply
The idea behind poply is that anyone can make a folder with items on a webserver.
You can then run a poply client on your desktop, in which you can subscribe to those webfolders.
This will load all the items, of which some are posts and some are replies.

Poply will then load the post and build the reply tree with all the replies it can find. Then, it will collapse the tree so
that we're left with one "social media" post, in a fully (very simplified) decentral manner.
