Very much still under construction, more of an idea than a working concept at this stage!

# poply
The idea behind poply is that anyone can make a folder with items on a webserver.
You can then run a poply client on your desktop, in which you can subscribe to those webfolders.
This will load all the items, of which some are posts and some are replies.

Poply will then load the posts it finds and build the reply tree with all the replies it can find. Then, it will collapse the tree so that we're left with one "social media" post, in a fully (very simplified) decentral manner.

Any reply from a person that you're not subscribed to will not be visible to you, even if a person that you're subscribed to
responds to those comments, because the branch from the post-tree will not be found. This could be a feature. An active webserver
(instead of just a static webfolder) could help with listing replies of people that one is not subscribed to.

The name should be clear by now, it's a contraction of post & reply. Basically an RSS feed with replies built in.
